    body: "“Honestly, happy gyud ko na finally, mabalik na sya, especially karun, TOUCH will be a great help sa students para madungug sila and para maka-inspire sa ubang students.” Christine Guaren, a graduating student of Geothermal Engineering, said in her response to her bliss upon knowing the renascence of The TOUCH Publication. In the wake of The TOUCH operating again under the shadow of the pandemic – where students are deprived of liberty from the outside world and information is just a few touches away, acquiring relevant and factual information is still a relative concern. Some senior students were interviewed on their reaction to CEA's current dissemination of information and how significant the resurgence of The Touch Publication will be. Johnny Angcon, a third-year civil engineering student, said it’s confusing for him due to certain reasons for CEA having different social media accounts as sources of information. “First it's confusing tungod sa kadaghan sa pages sa CEA department. Maglibog tag asa dapit jud mokuhag information daily,” he said. Angcon advised in his statement that having a separate organization operating solely for the purpose of spreading information would greatly benefit students in acquiring direct, valid information and announcements from the college. “Therefore, if you are working to create a certain group, organization, page or any related matters for unified information dissemination then that is a very good idea. Para ang CEA students dili na confused to visit pages for an update of any events, programs or any other related matters,” he said. In a separate interview with Lloyd Julius Fortuito, a third-year geodetic engineering student, he emphasized the significance apart from informative purposes. “Importante siya kay para pod ma-enhance ang skills sa mga writers sa ato nga college,” he said. As for Christine Guaren, she rather had an interesting response to the same said question. She furthered that they initially planned to revive the touch publication back then. “It's something nga wala namo nahimo atong okay pa ang tanan, nya karun despite sa situation nato, here it is na. Dugay ra gyud ning gina-mention sa amo ni Sir Angel, na ibalik na, but due to other commitments and pressure sa senior years, wa gyud nahimo,” she said. Guaren ended with her strong statement. “Voices will be heard.” As The TOUCH Pub slowly unfolds its curtains to service after a long time of silence, the students’ plea for a vivid, factual, and direct source of information; a hole that has never been plugged for years is now answered.",

    body: "Student Government of Dumaguete City Main Campus II conducted an oath-taking ceremony, today, August 13, 2021, for the newly elected and appointed officers via Zoom Meetings. The aforementioned event is the first-ever virtual oath-taking ceremony participated by the following organizations: Student Governments of Dumaguete City II College of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (CAFF), College of Criminal Justice Education (CCJE), College of Engineering and Architecture (CEA), Engineering and Architecture Student Society (EASS); United Architects of the Philippines Student Auxiliary (UAPSA-NC), Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers (PICE-NSC), Philippines Institute of Computer Engineering Students (PICES-NSC), Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers (IIEE-NSC), Institute of Electronics and Communications Engineers of the Philippines–NORSU Student Chapter (IECEP-NSC), Geodetic Engineering Student Society (GESS-NSC), Philippine Association of Geothermal Engineering Students (PAGES-NSC), Junior Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers–NORSU Student Chapter (JPSME-NSC), and American Concrete Institute of the Philippines–NORSU Student Chapter (ACI –NSC). This was spearheaded by Mr. Julio E. Ventolero, MMM, Director of Student Affairs and Services of NORSU, who bestowed his words of encouragement and initiated the pledge of service during the program. Mr. Ventolero highlighted the oath-taking ceremony as a very solemn promise made towards an institution. He furthered that people pledge not for themselves but in service of the public. A bible verse for the student leaders was featured in his message, Exodus 18:21—“But select capable men from all the people – men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.” Anyone can be a resilient leader if he/she puts God in his/her heart. “God put you in the position of service,” Mr. Ventolero addressed. Amidst the pandemic situation, Main Campus II student body officers were able to pursue their service to their beloved Negros Oriental State University (NORSU). The closing remarks was made by the incumbent COMELEC Chairperson of SGDC-II, Ms. Gretthel Ann Grampon and eventually culminated with some interesting insights shared by its hosts, Ms. Erica Sogone and Mr. Cyril Paglomutan.",

    body: "TAMBAYAYONG SAIS, the two-day online leadership training pioneered by the Student Government of Dumaguete City Main Campus II, organized its first part on August 13, 2021 at 2 o’clock in the afternoon. The first part featured its competent main guest speaker, Hon. Javan Lev Poblador, co-founder and former president of the Association of Young Environmental Journalists. He imparted empowering knowledge to the newly elected and appointed student government officers to prepare them for future endeavors and for leading followers down the right path. “There shouldn't be any excuses why you can't lead...When things don't go your way, it's not failure, it's only a change of strategy. You'll only fail when you stop doing something about it,” he expressed. Poblador also gave the audience a glimpse of what a good leader is, and shared experiences and lessons to inspire future leaders. \"Management is control and there are only three things we can control in life: quality, money, and time. But the people are not part of it because it falls under leadership,\" he added. In parting words, Poblador gave advice to the budding leaders to guide and help them blossom in the future. \"If you have that skill set to become a leader, please hone it and discipline it because it is the rarest commodity on the planet, and the world needs you,\" he concluded. Within the same day, the event paved the way for newly elected officers from the various organizations of the campus to introduce their goals and purposes of their respective organization. TAMBAYAYONG SAIS part two resumed on August 14, 2021, with its induction of elected and appointed SGDC-II officers headed by the newly elected President, Hon. Lester Janito. This was followed by the four sectoral talks in their separate meet rooms carried out by: Mr. Genesis Dimatulac for the Legislative, Engr. Christ Quinicot for the Executive Staff, Ms. Gwaineth Stefhan Pabinguit for the Executive Heads, and Hon. Vence Neil Megio for the National Officers. Dimatulac, a former three-term speaker of the House of Representatives, SGDC-I, conveyed important knowledge about the legislative sector and gave inspiring messages to the audience. \"Do not underestimate the power of the representatives. We must appreciate the power that we have and take responsibility for it,\" he uttered. At the same time, Quinicot, a former president of DOST Scholars’ Association of NegOr, talked about the positions under the executive staff, explained the roles, and explained how to help the executive heads. “All in all, you must work together,” he proclaimed. Simultaneously, Megio, an outgoing president of the Student Government of Dumaguete City-II, acquainted the student leaders and shared important points for the audience to ponder. He also provided relevant history about the organization and important tips for future leaders. Around 3:00 PM, Pabinguit, a delegate of the Philippine Model Congress 2019 in the Senate of the Philippines, gave a presentation coined by her own title—Leadership in a Nutshell, and shared various knowledge that will be helpful for officers’ and leaders’ future endeavors. Pabinguit said, “Not everyone was born a leader, but we can be molded to become a leader.” The giving of tokens and certificates to sectoral guest speakers came after. Hon. Alminda Nodado, the outgoing SGDC-II Vice President, expressed her sincere acknowledgement for all the participants, organizers, and guests. A video clip of the induction of outgoing officers of SGDC-II along with Hon. Megio’s concluding statements and sentimental closing marked the successful culmination of this year’s momentous virtual TAMBAYAYONG.",
